Add a method 'find()' to the union-find data type so that 'find(i)' returns the largest
element in the connected component containg 'i'. The operations, 'union()', 'connected()', and
'find()' should all take logarithmic time or better.
For example, if one of the connected components is {1,2,6,9}, then 'find()' method
should return 9 for each of the four elements in the connected component
